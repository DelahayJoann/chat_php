## Features to be implemented:

- **Homepage**: If you are not logged in, you can just read the messages, but not publish them. Instead of the message form, shows an invitation to log in or register. Of course, each form processing will be **sanitized** and **validated**.

- **Register**: To be able to create a Chat user account (a form to specify your email and password). When you register, no validation by email, you are directly registered (as long as the registration form has been correctly filled in.

- **Login/Logout** : to be able to connect to your account (email + password) and disconnect (logout) using PHP sessions.

- **Messages** : once logged in, be able to publish messages in the conversation.

- **Profile** : It is possible to update the user's account.

- **You have time left?**: 
  -  To make it a competitive product, we can also imagine to implement things like : replace smileys ``:-) :-( ...`` by emoji images.
  -  having an avatar as a profile picture for each user.
